Thanks for visiting my website! I am a final-semester Master's student in neurolinguistics at Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan. My current research focuses on the L1 transfer effect in L2 learning, using EEG and tDCS. Starting my PhD in April 2025, I look forward to continuing my research, with a particular focus on the role of the cerebellum.
